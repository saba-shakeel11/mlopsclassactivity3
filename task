Pre-work / Setup (Instructor provides)

The repo mlopsclassactivity2 (already provided).
Ensure each student/pair has a fork or cloned copy with push access (or via their own GitHub).
Quick review of the repo structure: train.py, app.py, Dockerfile.train, Dockerfile.serve, preprocess.py, requirements.txt, etc.
If needed: an existing Docker registry (DockerHub or similar) credentials for container push steps (can be simplified or mocked if network/time is short).


Activity Steps:
1. Fork the provided repository: mlops-ci-activity.
2. Explore the repository structure (preprocess.py, train.py, evaluate.py, requirements.txt).
3. Review the workflow file located at .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml.
4. Trigger the workflow by making a small change (e.g., edit README.md) and pushing to main.
5. Observe the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab.
6. Download the trained model artifact from the Actions run results.

Discussion Questions:
1 How does CI/CD improve collaboration in ML teams?
2 What happens if the evaluation score is below a defined threshold?
3 How can retraining or drift detection be integrated into this workflow?
4 What steps are needed to deploy this workflow to production (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes)?

Deliverables:
1 GitHub repository link containing your implemented workflow.
2 Screenshot of a successful workflow run with artifacts visible.
3 (Optional) Modified workflow with PR trigger or quality gate step.
